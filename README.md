# Day-19-Shell-Scripting-Project-Log-Rotation-Backup-Crontab
Day 19 focuses on building real-world shell scripting mini projects like log rotation, server backup, and scheduling tasks using cron.
You create a script to compress old log files and delete outdated archives.
You write a backup script that creates timestamped .tar.gz backups and removes old backups.
Finally, you schedule these scripts using cron jobs for automatic daily or weekly execution.
This day combines concepts like loops, conditions, arguments, error handling, and automation.
